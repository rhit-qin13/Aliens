 Based on that, we are able to estimate the rest of the stories 
 
## **Definition of Ready:**
- Story has title
- Has user stories sentences/ statements (As I… I want to.. So that..)
- Story has Additional Details & Acceptance Criteria
- Story is Estimated 
- Story added to a Sprint
- Story is priortized
- Story is broken down to small tasks

## Whole Team Relative-size Estimates: 
Met for 6 hours to dicuss product vision & user 
stories and we came up with the 38 Story Points 


### **Developers participated in estimating:**
- Kamsi

- Sam

  

# Sprint 1
-----------------

## Sprint 1 Forcast:
- 5 User Story Points

Explaination of forcast: This sprint is short with 4 business days only. Based on the product priotization, We selected the two highest priority user stories that fits the sprint.  


## The Rational of Forcast:
- Avaiable bussiness days in the sprint
- Since this is sprint 1, The team need some time to organize and work on the environment setup. 
- We have estimated our smallest user story “Support” in the product backlog which is a single webpage with a an email link as 1 point. And, we built the rest of our estimates based on that.
- This our first forcast for the first sprint. We are expecting to enhance our forcasting in future sprint based on sprint 1 outcome.

1. Home Page (2 points)
2. Mood Selector (2 points)
3. Contact Us (1 point)

* Sprint Forcast is 5 point and the user storis are matching that.

## Feedback from Stakeholder about sprint 1:
- Logo on main page is not clean looking. Need re-alignment. 
- Mood page link location is not convient
- Menu items size is small
- Contact us page needs some rework. re-align elements and revisit form size. 

Team will add the feedback as a new user story for sprint 2.  

## Sprint Retrospective: 
What is going well?
-We made a realistic velocity as our velocity was 5 and we got through 5 story points
-Our division of labor works well as everyone's skill sets are taken advantage of
-Our daily scrums made clear what we had done and what had to be completed for the next day

What isn't going well
-Impediments make it difficult to meet up physically
-Too much time spent on refactoring sprint backlog
-Tasks for Sprint backlog items needed constant adjustment and change

What we can enhance
- Detailing Impediments more concisely in our daily scrum
- Clearer tasks within PBIs taken into our sprint backlog during sprint planning
- Focus more on the MVP
  
  
## Updating PBI: 
the team reviewed the PBIs in the product backlog and made sure stories are true user stories.
